Description: Provides a set of utilities to calculate Fu's Fs and Strobeck's S statistics for arbitrary data sets. These population genetics statistics can be formulated in terms of Stirling numbers of the first kind. These Stirling numbers can easily exceed the floating point range for larger data sets that are common with genome sequencing data. This package provides a logarithmic estimator for Stirling numbers of the first kind, which enables calculation of these statistics for larger alignments.
